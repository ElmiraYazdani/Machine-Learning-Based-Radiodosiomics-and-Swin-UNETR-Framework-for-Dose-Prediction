# Machine-Learning-Based-Radiodosiomics-and-Swin-UNETR-Framework-for-Dose-Prediction
This repository presents a radiodosiomics framework for personalized [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in mCRPC. It includes feature selection and ML models using clinical, radiomic, and dosiomic features, plus nnU-Net and Swin UNETR DL models with SSL to predict Monte Carlo–based dose rate maps.
