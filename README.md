# Machine-Learning-Based-Radiodosiomics-and-Swin-UNETR-Framework-for-Dose-Prediction
This repository presents a radiodosiomics framework for personalized [¬π‚Å∑‚Å∑Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in mCRPC. 
It includes feature selection and ML models using clinical, radiomic, and dosiomic features, plus nnU-Net and Swin UNETR DL models with SSL to predict Monte Carlo‚Äìbased dose rate maps.

## üîç Machine Learning Pipeline
See [`radiodosiomics_ML.ipynb`](./radiodosiomics_ML.ipynb) for the full pipeline including:
- Feature selection (RFE, Boruta, LASSO, Mutual Information, and Elastic Net)
- Model training and evaluation
- Integration of clinical, radiomic, and dosiomic features
